**Q: "What's your disaster recovery strategy?"**
**A:** "Multi-region MongoDB Atlas replication, automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery, and infrastructure as code for rapid rebuilding. Our RTO is under 4 hours with RPO of less than 1 hour."

### **Project Management Questions:**
**Q: "How did you manage scope creep?"**
**A:** "Strict change control process with stakeholder approval required for any scope modifications. We maintained a product backlog with clear prioritization, and deferred non-critical features to future iterations."

**Q: "What was your biggest technical challenge?"**
**A:** "Real-time notification system integration while maintaining performance. We solved it with optimized WebSocket connections and intelligent batching algorithms that reduced server load by 60%."

### **Future-Oriented Questions:**
**Q: "How would you scale this to handle 100,000 users?"**
